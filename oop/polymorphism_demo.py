# You are tasked with creating a Python script named polymorphism_demo.py. In this script, define a base class Shape with a method area() and derived classes Rectangle and Circle, each overriding the area() method to calculate their respective areas.

import math

class Shape:
    def area(self):
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement this method")

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, length, width):
        self.length = length
        self.width = width

    def area(self):
        return self.length * self.width
    
class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return math.pi * (self.radius ** 2)
